﻿/*To the sales and marketing company's newest investment products, you send thousands of personalized letters to the company's existing clients. 
Your job is to write C# code to merge personalized information about the customer. 
The letter contains information like their existing portfolio and compares their current returns to projected returns if they were to invest in using the new products.
The writers have decided on the following example marketing message. Here's the desired output (using fictitious customer account data).


Dear Ms. Barros,
As a customer of our Magic Yield offering we are excited to tell you about a new financial product that would dramatically increase your return.

Currently, you own 2,975,000.00 shares at a return of 12.75 %.

Our new product, Glorious Future offers a return of 13.13 %.  Given your current volume, your potential profit would be ¤63,000,000.00.

Here's a quick comparison:

Magic Yield         12.75 %   $55,000,000.00      
Glorious Future     13.13 %   $63,000,000.00  
*/

string customerName = "Ms. Barros";

string currentProduct = "Magic Yield";
int currentShares = 2975000;
decimal currentReturn = 0.1275m;
decimal currentProfit = 55000000.0m;

string newProduct = "Glorious Future";
decimal newReturn = 0.13125m;
decimal newProfit = 63000000.0m;

// Your logic here

Console.WriteLine($"Dear {customerName},");

Console.WriteLine($"Currently, you own {currentShares:N0} shares at a return of {currentReturn:P2}.\n");
Console.WriteLine($"Our new product, {newProduct} offers a return of {newReturn:P2}. Given your current volume, your potential profit would be {newProfit:C2}.\n");

Console.WriteLine("Here's a quick comparison:\n");

string comparisonMessage = "";
// Your logic here

comparisonMessage += currentProduct.PadRight(20) + $"{currentReturn:P2}".ToString().PadRight(10) + $"{currentProfit:C2}\n";
